@chapter About penguin tower

Penguin tower is a multiplayer 2 dimensional game which was inspired
by a game from the late 1970s, Morloc Tower
@uref{http://www.mobygames.com/game/dunjonquest-morlocs-tower}
Although Penguin Tower is a very different game it does retain a
similar screen layout and many of the key commands are the same.

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible and to
inflict the most damage on other players.  The games genre is probably
a graphical multiuser dungeon which has a limited graphical interface
and limited number of objects and weapons.

Penguin tower consists of three main components, a client, a server
and a protocol.  The client is written in Python and it utilises the
pygame libraries.  The server is mostly written in Modula-2 and a
small amount of C.  The protocol is entirely character and string
based.

The pengiun tower server was written during two Augusts in 1985 and
1986 and originally ran on a 6 Mhz PC clone connected by two Visual
200 terminals (making it a three player game).  The maps were drawn
with simple ASCII characters, and it was quite playable (for those
days!).  The 6 Mhz PC ran the server code quite comfortably, it
occasionally slowed down, which perhaps added to its charm.

Some of the server code has been replaced to allow it to run under the
GNU Modula-2 coroutine set of libraries and also to allow arbitary
numbers of clients to connect using sockets.  The protocol has also
been retrofitted into the server code.

@chapter Obtaining penguin tower

You can download a copy of the game from
@uref{http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/download/penguin-tower/penguin-tower-@value{version-penguin}.tar.gz}
and then you need to extract the archive using the following command
line:

@example
tar xvf penguin-tower-@value{version-penguin}.tar.gz
@end example

The game consists of a client and server.  To run the client
you need to have installed @code{pygame} and then
should be able to run it by typing:

@example
mkdir -p build $HOME/opt
cd build
../penguin-tower-@value{version-penguin}/configure --prefix=$HOME/opt
python penguin-tower.py mcgreg.comp.glam.ac.uk:7000
cd ..
@end example

You can now install penguin tower by:

@example
cd build
make install
cd ..
@end example

Hereafter you can invoke the installed copy by:

@example
$HOME/opt/penguin-tower mcgreg.comp.glam.ac.uk:7000
@end example

However you will have had to set your path to include the
@code{$HOME/opt/bin} directory as specified by the initial
@code{./configure}.  If you just want to run @code{penguin-tower}
without installing it (perhaps to test the game).  Then skip the
install and just run it via the python interpreter thus:

@example
cd penguin-tower-@value{version-penguin}
python penguin-tower.py mcgreg.comp.glam.ac.uk:7000
cd ..
@end example

@node Building penguin tower, , (dir), (dir)

You can build penguin tower by:

@example
cd build
make
cd ..
@end example

The build will require @file{flex}, @file{gcc}, @file{gm2} (GNU
Modula-2 release >=0.62), @file{groff} and @file{pthreads} to have
been installed.

@node Penguin tower client options, , (dir), (dir)
@chapter Penguin tower client options

@pindex penguin-tower
@cindex invoking @command{penguin-tower}

Penguin tower can be invoked with the following options:

@table @code
@item -v
display the current version of penguin tower.
@item -h
display a synopsis of the command line options.
@item -w
run in full screen mode rather than in a window.
@item -f
identical to the @code{-w} option.
@item -d
turns on debugging messages
@item -Idirectory
specifies
@file{directory} as the location for where the subdirectories @file{data} and
@file{sound} exist.
@end table

lastly server and port address can be given.  For example:

@example
penguin-tower server-name.example.org:7000
@end example

@node Key commands, , (dir), (dir)
@chapter Key commands

The following table details the keys and their meaning.  @footnote{We
use the syntax [0-9] to mean any character 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
or 9.  Also \n indicates the <enter> key and Esc indicates the escape
key.}

@table @code
@item Esc
quit game

@item 1
move forward 1 unit

@item 2
move forward 2 units

@item [1-9]
move forward n units

@item g
get treasure (must be facing treasure)

@item d[1-9]\n
drop a treasure.  The treasure is one of 1 to 9.

@item d1[0-2]\n
drop a treasure.  The treasure is one of 10 to 15.

@item u[1-9]\n
use treasure 1 to 9. Note that only some of the
treasures can be used.

@item o
open a door, must be facing a door and next to it.

@item c
close a door, must be facing a door way and next to it.

@item e
examine a wall for a secret door, must be facing the wall
and next to it.

@item f
fire normal arrow.  An arrow travels at approximately 25 units
per second and they may be jumped over.  An arrow causes 23%
damage should it hit its target and costs a 70 Kg player 19%
fatigue.  An arrow may be repelled by the magic shield.

@item m
fire magic arrow.  A magic arrow travels at approximately 25 units
per second and they may be jumped over.  It causes 74%
damage should it hit its target and costs a 70 Kg player 27%
fatigue.

@item p
parry, must be directly facing an opponent.  It inflicts 6% damage and
costs a 70 Kg player 7% fatigue.

@item a
attack, must be directly facing an opponent.
It inflicts 13% damage and costs a 70 Kg player 11% fatigue.

@item t
thrust must be directly facing an opponent.
It inflicts 17% damage and costs a 70 Kg player 18% fatigue.

@item r
turn right.

@item l
turn left.

@item v
vault turn.
@end table

Notice that as your characters weight increase so it consumes more
fatigue to move forward, fire arrows and fight.  The weight of each
treasure is shown below together with its number and a summary of its
effect in the game.

@table @code
@item 1
Magic key, converts doors into the appearance of a wall - or a secret door.
Any player can use @code{e} to examine the wall for a secret door.
Although the player must be directly next to the original doorway.
No noticable weight.

@item 2
Crystal ball, can be used @code{u} to give hints as to where other
players are located.  Treasure weighs 33 Kgs.

@item 3
Magic spring, teleports you to a random room.  This treasure then
disappears to another random room.

@item 4
sack of coal, cursed and must be taken to a specific room.
It cannot be dropped until this room is reached and it weighs 150 Kgs!

@item 5
another sack of coal, identical to treasure 4.  It is unlikely that
a map has two sacks of coal, unless the map creator was having a
bad day.

@item 6
hot iron, weighs 4 Kg and inflicts 19% damage on the person who
picks it up.

@item 7
hand grenade. When it explodes it causes 69% damage, it weighs
3 Kg and can be used @code{u}.  When used, the pin is pulled
and it will explode in 25 seconds time.  The explosion effects
everyone in the same room.

@item 8
magic sword.  This weighs an additional 1 Kg, but it causes
additional damage to be inflicted when parry, attack or
thrust is used.  It also causes much less fatigue to be
used when fighting.  The damage for parry, attack and thrust
is: 8, 14 and 18.  The fatigue used is: 3, 7 and 12 respectively.

@item 9
magic shoes.  Makes running consume less fatigue (almost half the
amount).

@item 10
sleep potion.  This weighs 5 Kgs and puts the person who
picks it up to sleep for 24 second.

@item 11
repelling magnet.  Causes all treasures including the magnet
to flee from you and find random places throughout the map.
It also effects everyone in the same room in exactly the same way.

@item 12
treasure trove.  Can be used to locate all treasures in the map.
It weighs 53 Kgs.

@item 13
speed potion.  Raises players priority in the server, increasing the
response time relative to the rest of the players.

@item 14
magic shield.  Reflects normal arrows.  It weighs 2 Kgs but has no
effect on magic arrows.

@end table

On connecting you
should a screen similar to that below.

@center @image{initial,,4in}

You should then press any key (other than the escape key)
and you will be presented with the following screen.

@center @image{second,,4in}

The user has entered @code{fred} and is just about to press the
<enter> key.  After entering your name the screen will alter to
display a map on the left hand side and a status description on the
right hand side.
