@chapter About penguin tower

Penguin tower is a multiplayer 2 dimensional game which was inspired
by a game from the late 1970s, Morloc Tower
@uref{http://www.mobygames.com/game/dunjonquest-morlocs-tower}
Although Penguin Tower is a very different game it does retain a
similar screen layout and many of the key commands are the same.

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible and to
inflict the most damage on other players.  The games genre is probably
a graphical multiuser dungeon which has a limited graphical interface
and limited number of objects and weapons.

@chapter Obtaining penguin tower

You can download a copy of the game from
@uref{http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/download/penguin-tower/penguin-tower-@value{version-penguin}.tar.gz}
and then you need to extract the archive using the following command
line:

@example
tar xvf penguin-tower-@value{version-penguin}.tar.gz
@end example

The game consists of a client and server.  To run the client
you need to have installed @code{pygame} and then
should be able to run it by typing:

@example
cd penguin-tower-@value{version-penguin}
./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt
python penguin-tower.py moppsy.comp.glam.ac.uk:7000
@end example

You can now install penguin tower by:

@example
make install
@end example

Hereafter you can invoke the installed copy by:

@example
penguin-tower
@end example

However you will have had to set your path to include the
@code{$HOME/opt/bin} directory as specified by the initial
@code{./configure}.  If you just want to run @code{penguin-tower}
without installing it (perhaps to test the game).  Then skip the
install and just run it via the python interpreter thus:

@example
python penguin-tower.py moppsy.comp.glam.ac.uk:7000
@end example

@node Invoking penguin tower, , (dir), (dir)
@chapter Invoking penguin tower

@end table

@end table

Notice that as your characters weight increase so it consumes more
fatigue to move forward, fire arrows and fight.  The weight of each
treasure is shown below together with its number and a summary of its
effect in the game.

@table @code
@item 1
Magic key, converts doors into the appearance of a wall - or a secret door.
Any player can use @code{e} to examine the wall for a secret door.
Although the player must be directly next to the original doorway.
No noticable weight.

players are located.  Treasure weighs 33 Kgs.

@item 3

disappears to another random room.

@item 4
sack of coal, cursed and must be taken to a specific room.
It cannot be dropped until this room is reached and it weighs 150 Kgs!

picks it up.

@item 7
